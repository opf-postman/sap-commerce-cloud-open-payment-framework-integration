## Introduction ##
This Postman Collection aids in integrating [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/) into the Open Payment Framework (OPF).

The integration supports:

* Direct Debit Payments using Hosted Page
* Settlement - Delayed Capture Pattern
* Refund
* Reauthorization


### In summary ###
In summary, to import the [Postman Collection](mapping_configuration.json), this page will guide you through the following steps:

a) [Create your GoCardless Sandbox account](https://manage-sandbox.gocardless.com/sign-up).

b) Create a GoCardless payment integration in OPF.

c) Get the credentials for your GoCardless integration.

d) Prepare the [Postman Environment](environment_configuration.json) file so the collection can be imported with all your OPF Tenant and GoCardless Sandbox Account unique values. 

### Creating a GoCardless Sandbox Account ###
You can sign up for a free GoCardless Sandbox account [here](https://manage-sandbox.gocardless.com/sign-up).


### Creating a GoCardless Payment Integration ###
Create a GoCardless payment integration in the OPF workbench. For reference, see [Creating Payment Integration
](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/0996ba68e5794b8ab51db8d25d4c9f8a/20a64f954df1425391757759011e7e6b.html?state=DRAFT).

**Note**:

The Merchant ID is the Organisation Name you add when [Onboarding your brand](https://manage-sandbox.gocardless.com/onboarding/brand)


### Setting up Your GoCardless Sandbox Account to work with OPF ###
Once you have created you GoCardless Sandbox account, do the following to set it up to work with OPF:
2. Navigate to Developers -> Developers -> Create -> Webhook Secret



### Preparing the Postman environment_configuration file ###

**1. Token**

Get your access token by [creating an external app](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/0996ba68e5794b8ab51db8d25d4c9f8a/d927d21974fe4b368e063f72733bf0fe.html?state=DRAFT) and [making authorized API calls](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/0996ba68e5794b8ab51db8d25d4c9f8a/40c792e66e2942209dc853a43533d78d.html?state=DRAFT).

Copy the value of the access_token field (it’s a JWT) and set as the ``token`` value in the environment file.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure the value is prefixed with **Bearer**. e.g. ``Bearer {{token}}``.

**2. Root url**

The ``rootUrl`` is the **BASE URL** of your OPF tenant.

E.g. if your workbench/OPF cockpit url was this …

<https://opf-iss-d0.uis.commerce.stage.context.cloud.sap/opf-workbench>.

The base Url would be

https://opf-iss-d0.uis.commerce.stage.context.cloud.sap.


**3. Integration ID and Configuration ID**

The ``integrationId`` and ``configurationId`` values identify the payment integration and payment configuration, which can be found in the top left of your **Configuration Details** page in the OPF workbench.

* ``integrationId`` maps to ``accountGroupId`` in postman
* ``configurationId`` maps to ``accountId`` in postman

**4. accessToken**
In The GoCardless Dashboard,  navigate to Developers -> Developers -> Create -> Access Token with Read/Write Access

**5. webhookSecret**

From OPF copy the Notification URL from the General Section of your new created GoCardless Configuration.
In The GoCardless Dashboard,  navigate to Developers -> Developers -> Create -> Webhook
Set the Notification URL, a meaningful name and a cryptographically secure secret.

Use the same secret to set the ``webhookSecret`` value.


**6. GoCardlessWebDomain**

This element aims to point to the location of Javascript file for both the sandbox and production environments. Below are the possible values of this element:

``pay.gocardless.com`` for production script element

``pay-sandbox.gocardless.com`` for sandbox script element

**7. apiEndpoint**

``api.gocardless.com`` for production api

``api-sandbox.gocardless.com`` for sandbox api



### Allowlist
Add the following domains to the domain allowlist in OPF workbench. For instructions, see [Adding Tenant-specific Domain to Allowlist
](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/0996ba68e5794b8ab51db8d25d4c9f8a/a6836485b4494cfaad4033b4ee7a9c64.html?state=DRAFT).


``api.gocardless.com`` for production account

``api-sandbox.gocardless.com`` for test account
